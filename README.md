# Agile-Final-Project

This project demonstrates agile project management using ZenHub and GitHub. It involves playing the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. 

## Project Scenario

In this scenario, I will be working on developing the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. The stakeholders have provided the following requirements:

1. Ability to create a product in the catalog.
2. Ability to retrieve a product from the catalog.
3. Ability to update a product in the catalog.
4. Ability to delete a product from the catalog.
5. Ability to "Like" a product in the catalog.
6. Ability to "Dislike" a product in the catalog.
7. Ability to list all products in the catalog.
8. Ability to query a subset of products in the catalog.
9. The system must be hosted in the cloud.
10. The system must have automation to deploy new changes to the cloud.

## Project Management

I will be using ZenHub and GitHub for project management:

- ZenHub: The Kanban board will be used to create a backlog and sprint plan.
- GitHub: The code repository for the project.
